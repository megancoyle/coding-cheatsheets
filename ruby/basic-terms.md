# Ruby: Basic Terms
Ruby is an object-oriented programming language that was created in 1993 by Yukihiro Matsumoto.

## Classes
A Ruby class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.

## Data Types
Types of data used in the language include numbers, strings, ranges, arrays, and hashes.

## Hashes
Hashes are a collection of key-value pairs.

## IRb
Interactive Ruby (IRb) is a shell used for experimenting with Ruby. It's a console that you can use for the language in your terminal.

## Symbols
A symbol is an object type that is often used in hashes. They are denoted with a colon, like `:description`. The following is an example of how they would appear in a hash:

```ruby
person = {:name =>"Sarah", :id =>20, :birthday_month =>"October"}
```
