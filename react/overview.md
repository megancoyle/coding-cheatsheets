# React JS: Overview

## Components
Let you split the UI into separate, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. Components are similar to JavaScript functions.

## JSX
A JavaScript extension syntax that allows the use of HTML tags to render subcomponents. Developers can also use pure JavaScript with it.

## One-way data flow
Also know as one-way binding, is the way that React keeps everything modular and fast.

## Props
Arbitrary inputs that components accept. Props is short for properties.

## Virtual DOM
An in-memory data structure that updates only the areas on the DOM where changes have been made. That way the code only renders components that actually change instead of re-rendering the entire view.
