# Angular 1 JS: Overview
An open-source front-end framework.

## Custom Directives
Allow developers to specify custom and reusable elements and attributes that extend a page's HTML.

## Directives
Allow developers to extend the HTML of a page with new attributes. Examples include:

* ng-app
* ng-bind
* ng-model
* ng-model-options
* ng-class
* ng-controller
* ng-repeat
* ng-show & ng-hide
* ng-switch
* ng-view,

## Expressions
Expressions are written within double curly braces `{{ right here }}`. They can be written inside directives. The code within expressions runs a lot like regular JavaScript expressions.

## Scope
The binding part between the view and the controller - scope is available for both.

## Service
A service is a function available to a specific Angular JS application. Angular has several built-in services, including `$location`.

## Two-Way Data binding
The synchronization between the model and the view.
